# üìùTodoList-Project(Application)

The **To-Do List Application** is a clean and intuitive task manager built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps users stay organized by allowing them to create, edit, delete, and manage daily tasks.  
Users can add optional **due dates** to each task, making it easier to prioritize responsibilities.  
Tasks can be marked as **completed** with a single click, visually striking them out.  
The application features a **Dark Mode Toggle** for better accessibility and viewing comfort.  
Theme preferences are saved in **localStorage**, so the mode persists across browser sessions.  
Task data is also stored in localStorage, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.  
A modern and responsive design ensures the app looks great on both desktop and mobile.  
Each task includes easy-to-use **edit (‚úèÔ∏è)** and **delete (√ó)** buttons.  
Users can update task text and due date using inline editing.  
The task list is dynamically updated using JavaScript, offering real-time interaction.  
Input validation prevents the addition of empty tasks, improving usability.  
The UI includes a calming **background image** and a semi-transparent overlay.  
Dark mode introduces a sleek, accessible look for low-light environments.  
Tasks are displayed in individual cards with color-coded backgrounds.  
This app is ideal for anyone looking to simplify their day and boost productivity.  
No backend is required ‚Äì everything runs locally in the browser.  
It‚Äôs a great beginner-friendly project for learning DOM manipulation and localStorage.  
The codebase is simple, readable, and easy to extend with new features.
